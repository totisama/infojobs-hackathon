# About the project and Idea

This hackaton Project is related to Infojobs. The main goal was to create a new feature that can make improve Infojobs website. But not only the website, but also the EXPERIENCIE. And that's what we wanted to achieve with this hackaton idea.
Rodrigo and I came up with an thougth: as a developers, when you are looking for a job, whats the most frustrating for you?


Well, we make a couple of suggestions and we both agreed in one: requirements. 


As a developers, we KNOW what we KNOW. Right?  but sometimes, we want to know if we need to learn something new in order to reach a new job, or get a promotion. And when we look for jobs, we wanted to know if we have the necessary skills for the position. 


Long story short: Our idea was to develop a tech roadmap for developers. 
When you search for any position in Infojobs projects, you can now check if you have your necessary skills for the job. For now, we are asking CHATGPT what are the necessary skils for the job. But, with more effort, you can make more accurate the decision by retrieving personal information from your github account, your infojobs profile, and more.
